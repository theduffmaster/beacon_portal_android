beacon_portal_android
=====================

Please excuse the mess. I am currently reprogramming the app from scratch because when I began the project I barely knew how to program, and now the application's code is in an abysmal state.

The Beacon Portal website and more, easily accessible from your phone for Beacon Teachers and Students!

If you have any questions, comments, or find bugs (chances are there will be some) please email: lincolnbernard7@gmail.com, or rate the app and comment on it.

Also, if anybody thinks they can come up with better icons/banners, please email me.


Here is the previous home for the Beacon Portal source code: http://sourceforge.net/projects/beaconportal/
